/**
 * The ActionEngine service class. Manages sessions, streams, and connections.
 *
 * This class provides methods to establish and join connections, as well as
 * to set the action registry.
 *
 * The service can be instantiated with an optional action registry and
 * connection handler. If the action registry is not provided, it will be
 * initialized with an empty registry. If the connection handler is not
 * provided, it will be initialized with RunSimpleSession. The chunk
 * store factory is used to create chunk stores for new sessions. By default,
 * `LocalChunkStore`s are created.
 *
 * This class is thread-safe. Whenever a connection is joined, it is moved out
 * of the Service object under a lock, and the Service object is no longer
 * responsible for managing it. Action registry is set under a lock, and
 * getters use read locks.
 *
 * The Service object can be destroyed at any time, and it will take care of
 * joining all the connections and cleaning up all the fibers. However, the
 * Service object itself will not be destroyed until all the connections have
 * been joined.

   *
   * This method does not introduce a race with connection handlers, and
